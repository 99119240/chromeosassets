# Chrome Os Assets - Public

This is not orginized just a huge dump of files.
I did this at school and for a good reason chromebooks are a horrible item for any student as many people have proved and you may be thinking but "Windows laptops are more expensive" but take all  the cost for google admin,servers,storage, and all these extensions they pay for that track you like securly chromebooks are horrible they all die out in about a year. So any devs out there this is a public place for all the assets i will be releasing quickoffice.
